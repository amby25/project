About the Project
-----------------
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how a queueing application can be use for Council to input customers data, and store it in the 

application's database in first come first serve, and this is based on the type of services require by the customers, eg houseing, council-

tax, etc and at the date time the such services is being documented.


Configuration and Features
--------------------------
The project comprises of both client site and server site technology, the html and css is the main the technology
that is being used to developed the user interface, this is to enable the user to input data in the 
require field, and select the choice which is applicable on the radio button before submitting the form.
The html tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph" and so on the browsers do not display the HTML tags, 
but use them to render the content of the page, but in this project the html is embeded in the PHP code and we have the
file  as "index.php" and  CSS is a language that describes the style of an HTML document which describes how,
how HTML elements should be displayed.

For common application features, such as managing content, user accounts comes with many options that allow
site-specific configuration. In addition to the project, there are other features with functionality 
that are not included with the project.


PHP is the server language that is being used in this project for scripting because the scripts are executed on the server
and inserting the data into the database.PHP code are executed on the server, and the result is returned to the browser as plain HTML
PHP files having extension ".php" as it being used in the project as "database.php" this file comprises of database connections
and querry.


Installation
---------------------------
I use XAMPP tools primarily because I believe it allow me to be more productive, XAMPP stands for Cross-Platform (X), Apache (A), MariaDB 

(M), PHP (P) and Perl (P). It is a simple, lightweight Apache distribution that makes it extremely easy for developers to create a local web 

server for testing and deployment purposes. Everything needed to set up a web server – server application (Apache), database (MariaDB), and 

scripting language (PHP)  i wrote the system code using PHP, which is a very modern and powerful language. MYSQL Server as the back-end 

database.
In truth, the vast majority of developers have strong expertise on only one platform – so very, very few people are really in a position to 

say “this platform is better”. And the right platform may well depend on exactly what sort of application is being developed.




Apperance
---------------------
The appearance of this project is set by the design of it (fonts, colors, and layout).And this comes with custom design



Developing for the project
---------------------------

This Application contains an extensive API that allows you to add to and modify the functionality of the project. the API consists of 

"hooks", which allow application to react to system events and customize project behavior, and functions that standardize common operations 

such as database queries and form. The project is built from scrath without any frame work, it consist of the main folder "project", which 

include "styles.css" and "index.php" files, and another folder "classses" this folder conatain database files (Database.php) because 

phpmyadmin is used for the mysql. the time-stamp is beimg implimented that and thhis use to show the date and time of the inserted data in 

the database.



.:: DOCUMENTATION ::.

Just open the project folder and upload it into your web directory, after that just call index.php script within your broswer and have fun.
